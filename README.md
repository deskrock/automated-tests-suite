# automated-test-suite
The purpose of this repository is to hold end-to-end tests.
Look [Quick Start](https://selenide.org/2014/10/01/how-to-start-writing-ui-tests/) for details. 
## Our Goal
* Set Release quality better
* Code is working as expected with existing functionality
* Main functionality is working expected with related components 
* Master branch is tested before going to Production
* Make QAs aware of automation
* Figure out Continuity plan(Who/When/What). Make Automated tests mandatory to write (Find suitable QA as responsible for related test suite, compose Automation Test story tickets)


## What is the process?
* Run tests ~16:00 so someone responsible is there to understand/analyse
* Where results are reported? (Slack-alert)
* Should release stop (yes - when test be having complete coverage & QA support)

## Structure of writing the tests
* Page Object Pattern is used. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves donâ€™t need to change, only the code within the page object needs to change. Subsequently, all changes to support that new UI are located in one place.
